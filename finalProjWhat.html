            <h2>History of Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal design emerged from the disability rights movement, coined by Ronald Mace in the 1980s. Mace, an architect who used a wheelchair, developed the seven principles of universal design while working at North Carolina State University, transforming the field from narrow disability accommodations to a broader approach of designing for human diversity [1]. The Center for Universal Design, founded in 1989, further developed these principles, emphasizing that universal design benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities [2].</p>
            <p>The concept was significantly influenced by the independent living movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which challenged societal views of disability. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was a pivotal moment, legally mandating accessibility in public spaces [3]. Over time, universal design has expanded beyond physical spaces to digital environments, reflecting a growing understanding that inclusive design is a fundamental approach to creating experiences that work for the greatest number of people.</p>

            <h2>The 7 Principles of Universal Design</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Equitable Use - The design is both functional and marketable for people with all sorts of abilities.</li>
                <li>Flexibility in Use - People with all sorts of abilities and preferences are able to use it.</li>
                <li>Simple and Intuitve Use - No matter what a person's background or ability is, they are able to easily figure out how to use it.</li>
                <li>Perceptible Information - Improtant information is communicated to the user in multiple ways so that people with any ability can receive it.</li>
                <li>Tolerance for Error - Hazards are not easy induce and a wrong action does not lead straight to a hazard.</li>
                <li>Low Physical Effort - It does not require a lot of physical energy, effort, or strength to use.</li>
                <li>Size and Space for Approach and Use - People of all sizes and abilities can interact with it.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>WCAG Standards</h2>
            <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are organized around four primary principles, often referred to by the acronym POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust [4]. These principles ensure that web content is accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.</p>
            <p>Perceivable principles require that information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means providing text alternatives for non-text content, creating content that can be presented in different ways without losing information, and making it easier for users to see and hear content. Examples include providing alt text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and creating content that can be scaled without loss of information or functionality.</p>
            <p>Operable principles focus on ensuring that interface components and navigation must be operable by all users. This includes making all functionality available from a keyboard, giving users enough time to read and use content, avoiding content that could cause seizures, and providing ways to help users navigate and find content. Key considerations include creating keyboard-navigable interfaces, providing pause and stop controls for moving content, and designing navigation that is predictable and consistent.</p>
            <p>The Understandable principle demands that information and the operation of the user interface must be comprehensible. This involves making text readable and understandable, ensuring web pages appear and operate in predictable ways, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes. Specific guidelines include using clear and simple language, providing clear instructions, offering error identification and suggestions, creating consistent navigation and functionality, and ensuring that text is readable and understandable.</p>
            <p>The final Robust principle ensures that content can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This means creating web content that can be interpreted by current and future technology, including screen readers, alternative browsers, and other assistive technologies. The goal is to future-proof web content by ensuring compatibility with current and emerging technologies, following standard HTML and CSS practices, and providing robust, well-structured code that can be reliably interpreted across different platforms and devices.</p>

            <h2>Different Ways Websites Are Accessed</h2>
            <p>Screen readers are a critical assistive technology for individuals with visual impairments, using text-to-speech technology to convert digital text into synthesized speech or Braille output. These tools interpret web page structure, read link texts, describe images through alt text, and provide navigation cues that help users understand website content without relying on visual perception.</p>
            <p>Keyboard navigation enables users with motor disabilities to access websites using the Tab key for moving between interactive elements, Enter key for selecting links or buttons, and arrow keys for scrolling. Alternative input devices like head-tracking systems, eye-gaze technology, mouth sticks, and switch access systems can simulate keyboard inputs, allowing precise web interactions for users with limited mobility.</p>
            <p>Websites are now accessed through a diverse range of technologies, including touchscreen mobile devices, voice-activated browsers, smart home devices, and adaptive browser extensions. These varied access methods include tools that modify web content, such as text enlargement features, color contrast adjusters, and reading mode interfaces that simplify page layouts, emphasizing the need for flexible and adaptable web design.</p>
