        <p>As a senior at CU, I'm pursuing a major in CTD with minors in Space and Computer Science. I grew up as the youngest of 5 children alongside my identical twin sister. Our childhood was spent helping at my parents' small businessesâ€”a dirt bike track and a salvage yard. Those early experiences sparked my love for outdoor motorsports. Today, I still enjoy dirt biking and 4-wheeling.</p>

        <p>My passion for electronics and coding drives my academic pursuits, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge. When I'm not studying, you can find me writing, reading, gaming, or working at my parents' dirt bike track on weekends. I also work as a private tutor during the week. I'm looking forward to graduating in May 2025.</p>
